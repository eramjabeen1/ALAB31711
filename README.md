# typescript lab 317.1.1 – working with classes and generics

this project is part of my typescript learning journey. it covers the basics of classes, inheritance, types, and generics — with my own personal twist.

##  what's inside

- `vehicle` class with typed properties and constructor
- `car` and `motorcycle` subclasses (using inheritance)
- a function called `showStatus` to display the current state of a vehicle
- a custom generic class `mycycle<T>` that works with strings, numbers, or arrays
- methods inside `mycycle`:  
  - `print()` → shows one pair  
  - `printAll()` → shows all pairs  
  - `getTypeInfo()` → extra method i added to check data types
- tests using real-life and funny examples (because why not)
- a few commented-out lines to demo how typescript catches bugs early

##  how to run it

1. run `npx tsc --watch` to compile the typescript code
2. open `index.html` in your browser
3. open the console to see everything running

##  extra notes

- all required parts from the lab are included and clearly labeled
- names and comments were changed to match my style
- added one bonus method + detailed comments to show i understood the logic
- typescript made it way easier to catch mistakes before running anything

###  made with real code, real effort, and a little bit of personality.
